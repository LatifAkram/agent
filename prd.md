This is the single, opinionated architecture that delivers Manus‑level autonomy with open source only: conversational follow‑ups, parallel execution at scale, background persistence, long‑horizon memory, and verifiable outcomes. It’s tuned for speed, resilience, and transparency.

Executive summary
- Core stack: Kubernetes + Ray + Temporal + LangGraph, vLLM + LiteLLM router, Qdrant + Redis + Postgres, SearxNG + Playwright/Browser‑use + Crawlee, Superset + Plotly, Unstructured/Tika, Prometheus/Grafana + OpenTelemetry.
- Agent loop: Planner → Executor → Verifier with deterministic state, corrective retries, and publish step.
- Long context: Hybrid memory (Redis hot cache, Postgres durable state, Qdrant semantic memory) with rolling summaries and task pinning to simulate “10M context.”
- Parallelism: Ray actors + Kafka backpressure; 1,000+ docs in parallel, web research at scale, quant/insurance analytics, code/app generation.
- Autonomy: Temporal keeps jobs alive offline; agents checkpoint and resume; verifier enforces spec before completion.
- Transparency: Live trace UI (“AI’s Computer”) with step logs, browser snapshots, artifacts, and verifier verdicts.

Agent loop and state model
Planner
- Inputs: Goal, requirements, pinned constraints, relevant memory.
- Outputs: To‑do list (DAG), tool/model plan, success criteria, acceptance tests.
- Persistence: Writes plan, requirements, and acceptance tests to Postgres; pins key requirements to Redis.
Executor
- Behavior: Fans out sub‑tasks to Ray actors; uses tool registry (Browser‑use, Crawlee, SearxNG, SQL, file ops, code runners).
- Controls: Idempotent steps, retries with jitter, circuit breakers; progress events to Kafka and Temporal heartbeats.
- Artifacts: Writes raw outputs to object store (S3‑compatible) and registers metadata in Postgres.
Verifier
- Checks: Validates against acceptance tests and to‑do; schema assertions, coverage, freshness, and factuality via retrieval cross‑checks.
- Actions: On fail, amends plan and issues corrective sub‑tasks; on pass, signs and publishes.
Publish
- Deliverables: Reports (PDF/HTML), dashboards (Superset), code/apps (containerized), data bundles (Parquet/CSV).
- Audit: Immutable event log + artifact manifest for reproducibility.

Long‑context memory and “never re‑ask” behavior
- Redis (hot working set):
- Purpose: Current task state, last N tool outputs, pinned requirements.
- Policy: TTL with refresh‑on‑read; eviction favors least‑recent unpinned items.
- Postgres (durable task state):
- Tables: tasks, requirements, plan_nodes, tool_calls, verifier_checks, artifacts, preferences.
- Guarantees: Event‑sourced write‑ahead log; exact resume after crash or redeploy.
- Qdrant (semantic memory):
- Content: Chunked docs, prior runs, learned patterns; embeddings with BGE/E5; rerank with bge‑reranker.
- Retrieval: Task‑scoped first, then project/org; hybrid with OpenSearch filters.
- Context compaction:
- Rolling summaries: Convert old turns into structured digests (decisions, constraints, open threads).
- Context assembly: Each LLM call composes compacted summary + fresh retrieval + pinned requirements.
- Task continuity: New chat sessions auto‑attach to active task via task_id and load state silently.

Model serving and routing for speed
- Serving: vLLM with paged attention, tensor parallel; KV cache enabled; hot models pinned.
- Primary models:
- Tool/use & extraction: Qwen2‑7B‑Instruct, Mistral‑7B‑Instruct.
- Reasoning/verification: Mixtral‑8x7B‑Instruct or Qwen2‑72B‑Instruct (as budget allows).
- Vision: LLaVA‑Next.
- ASR/TTS: Whisper, Piper.
- Rerank: bge‑reranker.
- Routing (LiteLLM):
- Policy: Task‑type + latency + health; demote unhealthy models; A/B scorecards update weights.
- Batching: Fixed max batch/token rates to protect p95 latency.

Capabilities mapped to tools
- Deep web research: SearxNG for meta‑search → Browser‑use  official sessions → Crawlee extractors; dedupe, normalize to JSONL; store in OpenSearch + Qdrant.
- 1,000+ doc processing: Unstructured/Tika parsing → chunk/clean → Jinja2 templating → WeasyPrint PDF; parallelized via Ray; schema validation in verifier.
- Technical analysis & quant: yfinance/Alpha Vantage ingestion → Polars + TA‑Lib indicators → vectorbt/backtests → risk metrics; charts via Plotly; dashboards in Superset.
- Insurance analytics: SQL connectors → cohorting → Lifelines/GBM models → SHAP; verifier enforces AUC/PR and drift thresholds.
- Code/app generation: Plan UI/API → scaffold Streamlit/Reflex → tests → containerize → deploy to staging; verifier runs smoke/E2E.

SLOs and concurrency targets
- Web research: p95 8–12 min per package; 500 concurrent; ≤30 s queue wait.
- Doc processing: p95 3–5 min per 50‑page doc; 1,500 concurrent; ≤20 s queue wait.
- Quant: p95 90–180 s per symbol batch; 300 concurrent; ≤15 s queue wait.
- Verifier quality: ≥98% first‑pass for routine tasks; ≥90% for research/coding.
- Utilization: GPU 50–70% at peak; CPU 60–75%; KV cache ≥70% hit on repetitive patterns.

Deployment plan
Phase 1: Foundation 
- Infra: K8s, NGINX Ingress, Cert‑Manager, CSI drivers.
- Core services: Redis, Postgres, Qdrant, OpenSearch, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, Vault.
- Models: vLLM + LiteLLM with baseline models; enable KV cache.
- Search/ops: SearxNG; Playwright/Browser‑use worker pool; Crawlee service.
Phase 2: Agent system
- Workflow: Temporal server + workers; define Planner/Executor/Verifier workflows.
- Agents: LangGraph nodes with Pydantic schemas; Ray cluster for execution pool.
- Memory: Implement rolling summaries, pinned requirements, hybrid retrieval.
- UI: Console with live trace, browser snapshots, artifact previews.
Phase 3: Capabilities 
- Pipelines: Docgen at scale; web research; quant/insurance analytics; app generation.
- Verifier: Acceptance tests per domain; schema/coverage/freshness checks; corrective loop.
- Dashboards: Superset as code; Prom/Grafana SLO boards; latency, success, cost.
Phase 4: Scale and hardening 
- Autoscaling: HPA by queue depth and p95 latency; node auto‑provisioning.
- Isolation: Sandbox containers with egress allowlists; OPA policies; RBAC.
- Resilience: DLQs, replay tooling; chaos tests; disaster recovery runbook.

Minimal configs (essentials)
LangGraph state (Pydantic)
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional

class AcceptanceTest(BaseModel):
    id: str
    description: str
    check_type: str
    threshold: Optional[float] = None

class AgentState(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    requirements: Dict[str, Any]
    todo: List[Dict[str, Any]]  # DAG nodes with deps
    artifacts: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    evidence: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    acceptance_tests: List[AcceptanceTest]
    status: str  # planning|executing|verifying|publishing|done|error


LiteLLM routing policy (YAML)
models:
  fast: ["qwen2-7b-instruct", "mistral-7b-instruct"]
  reason: ["mixtral-8x7b-instruct", "qwen2-72b-instruct"]
  vision: ["llava-next"]
  rerank: ["bge-reranker"]

routes:
  tool_use:
    candidates: ["fast"]
    max_latency_ms: 1200
  verification:
    candidates: ["reason"]
    min_context: 8k
  vision_tasks:
    candidates: ["vision"]

health:
  demote_after_failures: 3
  cooloff_seconds: 60


Temporal workflow sketch (Python)
@workflow.defn
class TaskWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, task_id: str):
        state = await activities.load_state(task_id)
        state = await activities.plan(state)
        await activities.persist(state)

        while True:
            state = await activities.execute_parallel(state)  # Ray fan-out
            state = await activities.verify(state)
            await activities.persist(state)
            if state.status == "publishing":
                break

        await activities.publish(state)
        await activities.persist(state)



Governance, safety, and transparency
- Execution sandbox: Minimal containers, read‑only FS, per‑task temp volumes, outbound domain allowlists.
- Secrets: Vault‑issued short‑lived creds injected at runtime; no secrets in logs.
- Auditability: Event log with signed artifact manifests; reproducible replays.
- Transparency: Live trace (steps, prompts, tool calls, outputs), Playwright trace viewer, verifier verdicts, and resource panel.

What you’ll get from this approach
- Conversational continuity: Follow‑ups attach to the same task, reload state, and continue without re‑asking requirements.
- True autonomy: Background execution until verified completion, recoverable after failures.
- Lightning throughput: Parallel Ray actors with backpressure; cached models; efficient I/O.
- Quality control: Verifier gates that enforce spec and correctness before publishing.
- Visibility and control: Real‑time step‑by‑step transparency and manual intervention points.
